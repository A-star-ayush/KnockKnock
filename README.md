# KnockKnock

KnockKnock is a file sharing app for transfers over LAN.

While there are many ftp software suites out there, our aim is to seemlessly integrate the process with the already
existing file managers. For build v2.0, compatibility with ubuntu's deafult file manager, Nautilus, is provided.

File sharing could never been so simple. With KnockKnock, file transfer is only a right click away.

Dependencies: gcc, nautilus-actions
